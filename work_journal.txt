Working on right know: Step 3 (binning)
What's been done: Started the binning
Next step: See if the binning works, and then run CheckM to evaluate its performance

Finished the project plan
Started the FastQC analysis
Managed to run one sample
Moved files back and forth

2024-04-08
Ran the FastQC for the trimmed DNA and untrimmed RNA
Downloaded the HTML results to my computer
Started working on the RNA trimming. Have a test script to try (but it doesnâ€™t work). Gives an error stating that the ILLUMINACLIP command is not found (why??)

2024-04-09
Ran the Trimmomatic analysis
Started working on the megahit assembly

2024-04-12
For the Trimmomatic, I picked the paired output for further analysis
I ran FastQC on these four runs and downloaded the HTML results
For Megahit, I'll pool all samples and analyze them as one metagenome. Why? Because it gives one pool with more DNA --> more statistical information to get a good assembly.

Ran the metagenome analysis with Megahit, and it worked (I think).

Updated the Wiki with the results of step 1 (preprocessing).
Tried to run the metagenome evaluation with MetaQuast.
Started researching for the binning step.

The assembly evaluation is ok: The numbers differ because we use a subset of the data. And it's not surprising to get hits on wrong organisms, because we expect quite "unknown" organisms to turn up. We're not interested in the references, mainly in the statistics. 

Ran a first attempt at binning. Choose to not try and include the -a command (it needs an alignment file where the coverage of each contig is found, so that it can use that additional information for the binning).
The binning gave 26 bins.

Ran a first attempt at CheckM binning evaluation.
