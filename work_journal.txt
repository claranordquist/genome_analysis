Working on right know: Step 2 (assembly)
What's been done: RNA trimming is finished as well as the QC, submitted a first attempt at megahit assembly
Next step: Continue on the assembly

Finished the project plan
Started the FastQC analysis
Managed to run one sample
Moved files back and forth

2024-04-08
Ran the FastQC for the trimmed DNA and untrimmed RNA
Downloaded the HTML results to my computer
Started working on the RNA trimming. Have a test script to try (but it doesnâ€™t work). Gives an error stating that the ILLUMINACLIP command is not found (why??)

2024-04-09
Ran the Trimmomatic analysis
Started working on the megahit assembly

2024-04-12
For the Trimmomatic, I picked the paired output for further analysis
I ran FastQC on these four runs and downloaded the HTML results
For Megahit, I'll pool all samples and analyze them as one metagenome. Why? Because it gives one pool with more DNA --> more statistical information to get a good assembly.

Ran the metagenome analysis with Megahit, and it worked (I think).

Updated the Wiki with the results of step 1 (preprocessing).
Tried to run the metagenome evaluation with MetaQuast.
Started researching for the binning step.
