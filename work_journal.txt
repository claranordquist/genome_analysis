Work Journal: Genome Analysis project

Working on right know: Step 1 (RNA trimming), step 2 (assembly)
What's been done: RNA trimming is finished, started working on the megahit script
Next step: Continue on the assembly, run FastQC on the trimmed RNA

#####################################
Questions:
Trimmomatic
- Which of the output files should be kept/used? (forward/reverse paired/unpaired)
Megahit
- Should all the samples be pooled before assembly? (organisms from both high- and low-oxygen environments)
They do in the paper, but why?
- The paper mentions two parameters for their assembly (-pre_correction and -seed_kmer 55) but I can't find the corresponding for Megahit. Will that be a problem?

Finished the project plan
Started the FastQC analysis
Managed to run one sample
Moved files back and forth

2024-04-08
Ran the FastQC for the trimmed DNA and untrimmed RNA
Downloaded the HTML results to my computer
Started working on the RNA trimming. Have a test script to try (but it doesnâ€™t work). Gives an error stating that the ILLUMINACLIP command is not found (why??)

Ran the Trimmomatic analysis
Started working on the megahit assembly
